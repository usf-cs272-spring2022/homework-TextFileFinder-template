TextFileFinder
=================================================

![Points](../../blob/badges/points.svg)

For this homework assignment, you will create a class that finds all the text files (not directories) that end in the `.txt` or `.text` extension (case-insensitive). You must use streams and lambda functions for this assignment. You cannot use the `File` class in Java!

## Hints ##

Below are some hints that may help with this homework assignment:

  - If you are more comfortable with anonymous classes and the `File` class, start there. You will fail some of the tests, but you will be able to see whether you are finding the expected text files. Then, convert one thing at a time to use what is required.

  - Check out the [`Files`](https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~cs212/javadoc/api/java.base/java/nio/file/Files.html) class in Java. The `walk(...)` or `find(...)` methods may be helpful here.

These hints are *optional*. There may be multiple approaches to solving this homework.

## Requirements ##

See the Javadoc and `TODO` comments in the template code in the `src/main/java` directory for additional details. You must pass the tests provided in the `src/test/java` directory. Do not modify any of the files in the `src/test` directory.

See the [Homework Guides](https://usf-cs272-spring2022.github.io/guides/homework/) for additional details on homework requirements and submission.
